# The Business Task: Convert casual riders into members.

# The goal of the marketing team is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
# My task is to answer one of three questions that will guide the future marketing program - How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

# Company: Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago (fictional). A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. 
# Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike.


#The other two questions are: 1) Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 2) How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
  
#Key Stakeholders

# Primary stakeholder - the director of marketing

# Secondary stakeholders - the marketing analytics team and the executive team

# Key Findings

# On average, casual riders ride more than one time longer than members, and they ride oven longer on weekends.

# On summer weekends, casual riders' demand on bikes are larger than members.

# During the day, averagely, 3 PM to 7 PM is the peak time when number of rides of casual riders are greater than 125K.

# Similar to members, casual riders used docked bikes most frequently. The classic bike is the least popular bike type.

# Top three start stations for casual riders are 1) Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, 2) Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, and 3) Millennium Park


# Act

# Three Recommendations

# Form partnerships with local businesses around (within 1km from) top 20 used stations for casual riders (especially top 10 used start stations) to carry out marketing campaigns on digital media, targeting 1) local casual riders, 2) frequent visitors (commuters) to the businesses and stores around, 3) and or those who have similar social persona to Cyclistic members.

# Offer occasional membership discount to new riders on summer and holiday weekends

# Develop longer term marketing campaigns and digital media marketing message that focuses on communicating the benefits (price, discount, convenience) of riding with Cyclistic on trips longer than 20 minutes.
